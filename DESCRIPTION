Description: This package calculates the interval estimates for the parameters of 
 linear models heteroscedastic regression using bootstrap - (Wild Bootstrap) and double
 bootstrap-t (Wild Bootstrap). It is also possible to calculate confidence intervals using
 the percentile bootstrap and percentile bootstrap double. It is possible to calculate
 consistent estimates of the covariance matrix of the parameters of linear regression models
 with heteroskedasticity of unknown form. The package also provides function to calculate
 consistently the covariance matrix of the parameters of linear models with heteroskedasticity
 of unknown form.
